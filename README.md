## Hi there 👋

AI Systems Architect | LLM Infrastructure Engineer | Production AI Design

I design and build production-grade AI systems focused on reliability, scalability, and real-world business impact.

My work spans:

- Agentic CRM Intelligence
- Hybrid Retrieval & Ranking Systems
- Multi-Tenant RBAC Architectures
- AI Campaign Automation Engines
- Document Intelligence Pipelines
- Real-Time AI Session Processing
- Cross-Service Data Synchronization

## Engineering Philosophy

I focus on:

• Clear system boundaries  
• Modular AI orchestration  
• Cost-aware LLM usage  
• Hybrid retrieval over blind generation  
• Deterministic layers over uncontrolled prompting  
• Production-first design  

AI systems should be explainable, scalable, and resilient — not just impressive demos.
